Project Exam 1 Re-sit: Build a Photo Library

You have been tasked with building a photo library using the Unsplash API
https://unsplash.com/developers. The target audience for the website is students who need to
find free stock images to use in their projects.
The student should create an Adobe XD prototype of the website which they use when building
the website.
The site must have the following pages:
- Home page
- Images search results page
- Image specific page
- Photographer page
The site must have the following functionality:
- The home page should welcome the user and explain what the site is about.
- The home page should have a search bar where users can input a search term to look
for images.
- Once the user has input a search term in the search bar and clicked the search button,
they should be taken to a results page with a list of all the images related to their
search.
- There should be 10 results on the page, once the user has scrolled to the bottom of the
results there should be an option to ‘View More’ which would load another 10 images
to that page.
- The results page should tell the user a total number of images related to their search.
- The user should be able to click an image and be taken to view the ‘image specific page’
where they can see only that image with details about the image including the
photographer’s name, location and a description of the image.
- The user should be able to click the photographer’s name and be taken to a page with at
least the photographer’s name, profile image, and a list of their photographs which link
to the image specific page for each photograph.
Important points:
- The website must be responsive across screen sizes.
- The HTML, CSS and JavaScript must be written by the student. The HTML must be
semantic using appropriate HTML5 elements, the CSS should follow the DRY principle,
and the JavaScript should be succinct and bug free.
- The Unsplash API must be used.
- The website should be SEO and WCAG compliant with images having alt text, pages
having relevant meta descriptions, titles and unique h1s.
- The website must be well designed and appropriate for the target audience.
The Unsplash API
- You will need to register with Unsplash to get a key to access the API. View the following
link https://unsplash.com/documentation#public-authentication in the documentation
to see how to add the API key to the URL you’re making an API call to
- Once you have registered you need to create an app. You can keep the app’s status as
‘demo’ and don’t need to apply for production.
- Read through the documentation which thoroughly explains how to make calls to the
API.
Delivery
- A URL to the website on your web host
- A link to a GitHub repository with the final version of the code for the site
- A link to an Adobe XD prototype
- A report covering the process and decisions made during the project. Word count of
1000 to 2000 words.
